# An Obstacle Avoiding Robot in Arduino

Welcome to this repository containing the source code for an Obstacle Avoidance Robot I built with Arduino (A C++ Framework). This robot is designed to navigate its environment while identifying obstacles in its path. It utilizes an ultrasonic sensor to detect obstacles and then employs the code in this repository to determine the optimal path to avoid colliding with those obstacles.

### Note: Due to the presence of hardware components, the complete Arduino UNO [kit](https://store.arduino.cc/products/arduino-starter-kit-multi-language) is necessary to see the robot in operation.

## Introduction

The following code embodies a calculator application that features a graphical user interface (GUI), characterized by its simplicity and utilitarian nature.

## Dependencies

To run this implementation, you need:

- Python 3.x
- The `tkinter` module (usually included in Python standard library)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/elcruzo/gui-calc.git
   cd gui-calc
   ```

2. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can check by running:

   ```bash
   python3 --version
   ```

   If Python is not installed, you can download it from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Usage

1. Navigate to the project directory containing the `index.py` file.

2. Open the `index.py` file in your preferred text editor or IDE.

3. Run the `index.py` script using the following command:

   ```bash
   python3 index.py
   ```

6. Upon execution, the script will present a pop-up displaying the familiar calculator interface, allowing you to proceed with its utilization.

## Example

Here's a brief example of how to run the code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/elcruzo/gui-calc.git
cd gui-calc
python3 index.py
```

You will see a change show up on the text grid with each click of a button, displaying the result when you perform operations.
